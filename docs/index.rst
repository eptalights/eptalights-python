eptalights documentation
===============================

The **Eptalights Python Library** is a powerful Python package designed to help hackers, researchers, and developers effortlessly perform code analysis, discover bugs, conduct variant analysis, and more.

Effortlessly analyze program structures, functions, and call sites, and save time by quickly identifying complex variables with support for SSA variables, control flow graphs (CFGs), and more in a simple, Pythonic way. Think of it as Binary Ninja, but for source code.

Automate detailed code analysis rules, patterns, or variants more naturally with simple Python APIs, without needing to learn a custom DSL, in both small and large codebases.
